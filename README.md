# create-team-html
## Decription
This command-line application takes in user input to create an html page of the user's team. The user answers prompts regarding his or her employees' data to easily create a page.

##Trouble
I am stuck trying to get the input to render inside the template literal and concatenate into one long string. Will get back to it ASAP.

## Tests
None yet.
